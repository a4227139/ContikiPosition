/**
 * \file
 *         Testing the multihop forwarding layer (multihop) in Rime
 * \author
 *         Adam Dunkels <adam@sics.se>
 *
 *
 *         This example shows how to use the multihop Rime module, how
 *         to use the announcement mechanism, how to manage a list
 *         with the list module, and how to allocate memory with the
 *         memb module.
 *
 *         The multihop module provides hooks for forwarding packets
 *         in a multi-hop fashion, but does not implement any routing
 *         protocol. A routing mechanism must be provided by the
 *         application or protocol running on top of the multihop
 *         module. In this case, this example program provides the
 *         routing mechanism.
 *
 *         The routing mechanism implemented by this example program
 *         is very simple: it forwards every incoming packet to a
 *         random neighbor. The program maintains a list of neighbors,
 *         which it populated through the use of the announcement
 *         mechanism.
 *
 *         The neighbor list is populated by incoming announcements
 *         from neighbors. The program maintains a list of neighbors,
 *         where each entry is allocated from a MEMB() (memory block
 *         pool). Each neighbor has a timeout so that they do not
 *         occupy their list entry for too long.
 *
 *         When a packet arrives to the node, the function forward()
 *         is called by the multihop layer. This function picks a
 *         random neighbor to send the packet to. The packet is
 *         forwarded by every node in the network until it reaches its
 *         final destination (or is discarded in transit due to a
 *         transmission error or a collision).
